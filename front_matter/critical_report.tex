  1 & – & – & \A1 only contains the last page of the Kyrie. Haydn noted that the movement comprises 85 bars, which implicates that a single (double-sided) page with bars 1–55 of the \textit{Kyrie} has been lost. While \A1 and \A2 are cited as distinct pieces in the catalogue of works (MH 2 and 3, respectively), they likely belong to the same mass due to similar types of paper, hand writing, and compositional technique, with the last movement in \A1 ending on the dominant (A major) and the first movement of \A2 picking up the A in the fugue theme. \\
    & – & vl & \A1 only contains a single unlabeled staff with bars 79–85, which most likely belong to vl 1. The remainder of vl 1, as well as all of vl 2 play unision with S and A, respectively, in this edition. \\
    & 67   & S & bar illegible due to manuscript damage \\
  \midrule
  2 & 1 & vl & 1st to 5th \eighthNote\ illegible due to manuscript damage \\
    & 189  & B & 1st to 3rd \quarterNote\ in \A1: a8–a16–a16–e8–\sharp c8–A4 \\
    & 274 & org & 1st \quarterNote\ in \A2: f8–e8 \\
    & 292–310 & vl 2 & There is no indication of vl 2 in \A2. Here, it plays unison with A in bars 292–303 (1st \eighthNote) and the unison with vl 1 until the end of the movement. \\
  \midrule
  3 & – & vl & missing in \A2, here unison with S and A \\
    & 74f & org & upper voice omitted in this edition \\
