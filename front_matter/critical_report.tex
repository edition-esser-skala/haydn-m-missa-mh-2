  1 & – & – & \A1 only contains the last page of the Kyrie. Haydn noted that the movement comprises 85 bars, which implicates that a single (double-sided) page with bars 1–55 of the \textit{Kyrie} has been lost. \\
    & – & vl & \A1 only contains a single unlabeled staff with bars 79–85, which most likely belong to vl 1. The remainder of vl 1, as well as all of vl 2 play unision with S and A, respectively, in this edition. \\
    & 67   & S & bar illegible due to manuscript damage \\
